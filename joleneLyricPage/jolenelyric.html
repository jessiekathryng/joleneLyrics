        <br>
        <b>Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene</b>
        <br>Oh, I'm begging of you please don't take my man.</br>
        <b>Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene</b>
        <br>Please don't take him even though you can.
        <br>
        <br>Your beauty is beyond compare,
        <br> With flaming locks of auburn hair,
        <br> With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green.
        <br> Your smile is like a breath of spring,
        <br>Your skin is soft like summer rain,
        <br>And I can not compete with you, Jolene.
        <br>And I can easily understand
        How you could easily take my man
        <br>But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene.
        <br>He talks about you in his sleep,
        <br>There's nothing I can do to keep
        From crying
        <br>when he calls your name, Jolene.
        </br>
        <br><b>Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene</b></br>
        Please don't take him even though you can.
        <br>I had to have this talk with you,
        My happiness depends on you,
        <br>And whatever you decide to do, Jolene.
        <br>And you could have your choice of men,
        <br>But I could never love again,
        <br>Cause he's the only one for me, Jolene.<p><b>
                Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene</b>
            <br>Oh, I'm begging of you please don't take my man.
            <br><b>Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene</b></br>
            Please don't take him even though you can.
            </br>
            <br><b>Jolene, Jolene...</b></br>
